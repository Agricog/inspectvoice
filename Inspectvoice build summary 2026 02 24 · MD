# InspectVoice Build Summary — 24 February 2026

## Overview

Full-day build session covering PWA implementation, 6 production features for council tender readiness, and a complete procurement documentation pack. All code follows Autaimate v3 build standard: TypeScript strict, zero `any`, server-side validation, multi-tenancy isolation, offline-first.

---

## Session 1: Status Check & PWA Implementation

### Batch 20 Status Verification
- Confirmed Batches 1–17 (frontend) and Batch 18 (full Cloudflare Workers backend, 34 files) complete
- Reviewed package.json, tsconfig.json, and InspectionList.tsx to assess current state
- No code changes — verification only

### PWA Service Worker & Offline Support
- **vite-plugin-pwa configuration** — Workbox-based service worker with runtime caching strategies
- **Web app manifest** — standalone display, InspectVoice branding, icon set
- **Icon generation** — full PWA icon suite for iOS/Android install
- **Update prompt UI** — toast notification when new version available
- **Offline-first caching** — API responses cached, stale-while-revalidate for assets

---

## Session 2: Feature Roadmap (6 Features for Council Tender)

### Feature 1: CSV/Excel Defect Export ✅

**Purpose:** Councils need to interrogate defect data across all sites in Excel — this is a standard tender requirement.

**Files delivered:**
| File | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Worker endpoint | `workers/src/routes/defectExport.ts` | Server-side Excel generation with SheetJS, multi-sheet workbook (Defects, Summary by Site, Summary by Risk), risk colour-coding, auto-filters |
| Client service | `src/services/defectExport.ts` | Client-side fallback using SheetJS for offline export capability |
| UI component | `src/components/DefectExportButton.tsx` | Download button with date range filter, site filter, format selector (XLSX/CSV) |

**Key details:**
- Citywide summary with defect counts by site and risk level
- Colour-coded risk ratings (Very High = red, High = orange, Medium = yellow, Low = green)
- BS EN references included per defect
- Photo reference column cross-linked to evidence log
- Auto-filters and frozen header rows for easy council interrogation

---

### Feature 2: Make Safe / Close Asset ✅

**Purpose:** When a dangerous defect is found, inspectors need a formal workflow to isolate equipment immediately with evidence trail.

**Files delivered:**
| File | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Migration | `migrations/002_make_safe.sql` | `asset_safety_actions` table with RLS, status enum (make_safe/closed/reopened), evidence fields |
| Worker endpoint | `workers/src/routes/safetyActions.ts` | POST/GET/PATCH endpoints with validation, org isolation, audit logging |
| UI modal | `src/components/MakeSafeModal.tsx` | Full-screen modal with action type selection, photo capture, description, confirmation |
| DefectTracker update | `src/components/DefectTracker.tsx` | Integration point — "Make Safe" button appears on Very High/High risk defects |

**Key details:**
- Two actions: Make Safe (temporary isolation) and Close Asset (formal removal from service)
- Mandatory photo evidence of isolation measures taken
- Timestamped audit trail (who, when, what action, GPS)
- Reopening requires separate authorised action with reason
- Offline-capable — actions queued and synced

---

### Feature 3: Photo Coverage Validation + Cross-Referencing ✅

**Purpose:** Evidence-grade photo documentation with sequential numbering and defect cross-references in PDF reports.

**Files delivered:**
| File | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Photo coverage service | `src/services/photoCoverage.ts` | 5 validation rules (3 blocking, 2 warning), photo index generation, cross-reference maps |
| Worker PDF generator | `workers/src/services/pdf.ts` | Updated with 7-column defect register, Photo Evidence Log (Section 7), blue photo refs |
| Client PDF generator | `src/services/pdfGenerator.ts` | Updated with Photo Evidence Log (Section 6), compact P1–P5 range formatting |

**Validation rules:**
1. ≥1 photo per asset (blocking)
2. ≥1 photo per high-risk defect (blocking)
3. ≥1 overview photo per inspection (blocking)
4. Photo recommended for medium risk defects (warning)
5. ≥2 photos for assets with defects (warning)

**Key details:**
- Sequential photo numbering: P1, P2, P3… across entire inspection
- Cross-reference maps linking defects ↔ photos bidirectionally
- Photo association via caption substring matching with fallback logic
- Both PDF generators updated with evidence log sections
- Validation blocks sign-off if minimum coverage not met

---

### Feature 4: AI Completeness Checks Before Sign-Off ✅

**Purpose:** Review gate that intercepts sign-off with deterministic quality checks — catches missing data before the report is finalised.

**Files delivered:**
| File | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Worker endpoint | `workers/src/routes/completenessCheck.ts` | POST endpoint with 10 checks, quality scoring (A–F grades), `canSignOff` boolean |
| Modal component | `src/components/CompletenessCheckModal.tsx` | Full-screen modal with online/offline modes, grouped issues, severity indicators |
| Review page update | `src/pages/InspectionReview.tsx` | Sign-off flow updated, button changed to "Review & Sign Off" |
| Router wiring | `workers/src/index.ts` | Added completenessCheck route |

**10 checks:**
1. Condition ratings on all assets
2. Defect completeness (description, risk, remedial action)
3. BS EN references on defects
4. Voice notes or written observations
5. Photo coverage (delegates to Feature 3 service)
6. Closure consistency (signed items match completion state)
7. Inspector summary present
8. Condition vs risk conflicts (e.g., "Good" condition with "Very High" defect)
9. Defect count vs condition alignment
10. BS EN inspection point coverage

**Key details:**
- Quality score: 100 base, −15 per blocking issue, −5 per advisory
- Grades: A (90+), B (80+), C (70+), D (60+), F (<60)
- Blocking issues prevent sign-off; advisory allows proceed with acknowledgment
- Works offline with local validation fallback (subset of checks)
- No AI API calls — entirely deterministic for reliability and speed

### Feature 5: Baseline Photo Comparison ✅

**Purpose:** Side-by-side comparison of baseline/reference photo against current inspection photo for deterioration tracking over time.

**Files delivered:**
| File | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Migration | `migrations/003_baseline_photos.sql` | 6 baseline columns on assets table, `asset_baseline_history` audit table, RLS policies |
| Comparison component | `src/components/BaselineComparison.tsx` | Touch-friendly slider with 3 states, snap buttons, condition badges, deterioration detection |
| Capture page update | `src/pages/InspectionCapture.tsx` | Baseline data loading, first photo tracking, comparison display, "Set as Baseline" handler |

**Key details:**
- Baseline columns: `baseline_photo_url`, `baseline_photo_r2_key`, `baseline_photo_taken_at`, `baseline_photo_taken_by`, `baseline_photo_inspection_id`, `baseline_condition`
- Three UI states: no baseline / baseline only (first inspection) / full comparison
- CSS clip-path slider with pointer capture for smooth mobile touch
- Condition change detection: red "Deteriorated" or green "Improved" badges
- Baseline history table for full audit trail of when baselines were set/replaced
- Inspector can designate first photo of each asset as new baseline

## Build Standards Applied

- **TypeScript strict** — zero `any`, all interfaces explicitly typed
- **Server-side validation** — never trust client data, Zod schemas on all endpoints
- **Multi-tenancy isolation** — `org_id` on every table, RLS policies, server-side enforcement
- **Offline-first** — IndexedDB for local state, queue-and-sync pattern, graceful degradation
- **Audit logging** — all state changes logged with requestId, userId, orgId, timestamp
- **BS EN 1176-7 compliance** — inspection structure, risk methodology, report format aligned to standard
- **UK GDPR aligned** — DPIA completed, DPA template provided, retention policies defined, data subject rights supported

---

## What's Next

1. **Deploy migrations** — Run 002_make_safe.sql and 003_baseline_photos.sql against Neon
2. **Wire Features 1–5** — Integrate code files into the existing InspectVoice codebase (Batch 20+)
3. **Customise procurement pack** — Fill in placeholder fields, verify pricing, get DPA reviewed by solicitor
4. **Cyber Essentials certification** — Apply Q3 2026, controls already mapped and met
5. **Sample PDF report** — Generate a redacted sample inspection PDF for inclusion in procurement pack
6. **Pilot outreach** — Procurement pack enables approaching councils with a 60-day free pilot offer
